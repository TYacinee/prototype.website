          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Video games are becoming increasingly popular around the world,
            attracting people of all ages and backgrounds. Yet, within this vast
            industry, one particular category has started to rise to prominence:
            competitive gaming, or esports. In major tournaments, players face
            off in different games to determine the best of the best. However,
            for many newcomers, whether they are already familiar with gaming or
            complete beginners, the competitive scene can feel overwhelming,
            leading some to give up early. Among the numerous titles that
            dominate the esports landscape, Rocket League stands out as one of
            the most dynamic and accessible. Combining the mechanics of football
            with the physics of rocket-powered cars, the game has built a
            massive international following. Its simple concept, yet incredibly
            high skill ceiling, make it both easy to learn and difficult to
            master an ideal formula for competitive play. With major
            tournaments, professional leagues, and a passionate global
            community, Rocket League has become a flagship example of how a game
            can thrive in the esports world. Studying and developing tools
            around it, therefore, provides valuable insights into performance
            analysis, player development, and the broader dynamics of
            competitive gaming.

          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            This project aims to address that challenge by creating a kind of
            virtual coach. By analyzing gameplay and providing personalized
            advice, this coach will help players gain a better understanding of
            competitive gaming. It will offer them guidance on strategies,
            mechanics, and overall performance, making the esports world more
            accessible not only to experienced gamers but also to those who are
            just beginning to explore it.

          <h2>The EVA Coach</h2>
          <p>
            EVA will help both newcomers and experienced players enhance their
            performance in Rocket League. Powered by thousands of gameplay data
            points, this AI-driven assistant analyzes individual playing styles
            to deliver tailored feedback and actionable insights. Players can
            provide their own replays or specific areas they wish to improve,
            and EVA will respond with precise recommendations and ranging from
            strategic positioning to mechanical execution. What makes EVA stand
            out is its adaptability and accessibility. Unlike traditional
            coaching, which often requires human availability and high costs,
            EVA offers continuous, personalized guidance to anyone, anytime.

          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            My motivation is to merge the rigor of data science with the
            creativity and emotional depth of gaming. As someone passionate
            about video games and the cultural worlds they create, I believe
            that competitive gaming shouldn’t be limited to a small group of
            experts. EVA was born from the idea that it can be a tool for
            inclusion, a way to make the esports scene more accessible,
            understandable, and empowering for everyone. By transforming complex
            performance data into clear and personalized insights, EVA helps
            players not only improve their gameplay, but also build confidence,
            curiosity, and a deeper understanding of what makes esports so
            fascinating. In the end, this project isn’t just about winning
            matches, it’s about learning, growing, and sharing the joy of gaming
            through the lens of data.
